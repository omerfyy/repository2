## h2 Bereiding

* Remove the cap from the mushrooms. Slice the stalk lengthwise into roughly 3 x 2 inch thick slices.
* Whisk all the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl, add the mushroom slices to the bowl and coat well in the marinade.
*In a large bottomed flat pan, heat 1Tbsp of oil over a high heat, add the mushrooms to the pan in an even layer, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 1-2 minutes per side adding a few tablespoons of water to stop the mushrooms from drying out and becoming chewy.
* While the mushrooms are cooking, toast your buns and get your toppings ready.
* Toss the cooked mushrooms in a bowl with the marinade, coating them well.
* Serve 3 slices of mushroom per serving. Serve on your favourite lightly toasted bun, with some vegan mayo, pickles and we used some red sauerkraut but you could use coleslaw too. Enjoy!
* Eet smakelijk!
